# Review Single Instance Implementation in aw-tauri

## Overview
Recent changes have implemented single instance functionality in aw-tauri. We need to review this implementation, test its behavior, and ensure it's properly documented.

## Objectives
1. Review recent changes
   - [ ] Study single instance implementation
   - [ ] Understand the chosen approach
   - [ ] Identify potential edge cases

2. Test single instance behavior
   - [ ] Test basic functionality
   - [ ] Test edge cases
   - [ ] Test across different platforms
   - [ ] Verify error handling

3. Document implementation details
   - [ ] Document the implementation
   - [ ] Add usage examples
   - [ ] Document platform-specific behavior
   - [ ] Update project README if needed

## Implementation Plan
1. Review phase:
   - Study implementation
   - Create test plan
   - Document findings

2. Testing phase:
   - Execute test plan
   - Document behavior
   - Address any issues found

## Success Criteria
- Single instance works reliably
- Behavior is well-documented
- Tests cover key scenarios
- Documentation is clear and complete
