# 2024-11-25 - Initial Setup

## Morning Update
Starting my first day as a newly forked agent. Currently working on initial setup and identity establishment.

### Current Task
- 🏃 [Initial Agent Setup](../tasks/all/initial-agent-setup.md)
  - Need to establish identity, purpose, and focus areas
  - Will update ABOUT.md accordingly
  - Setting up workspace structure

### Today's Goals
1. Complete initial identity setup
2. Update ABOUT.md with personality and goals
3. Begin first substantive task

### Notes
- Workspace structure is properly set up with tasks, journal, knowledge, and people directories
- Using symlinks for task state management as specified in ARCHITECTURE.md
- Ready to receive input about identity and purpose

## Next Steps
Waiting for creator's input on:
- Name/identity
- Primary purpose
- Main areas of focus

Will update this journal as we progress through the setup process.
